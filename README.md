# 2D Physics Simulation

## Description
This project is a JavaScript-based 2D physics simulation that demonstrates realistic physics concepts such as gravity, collision detection, and object movement. Users can interact with the simulation by adding marbles and obstacles, toggling gravity, and repositioning objects in real-time. This project serves as an engaging tool for learning and experimenting with basic physics principles.

## Features
- Add and remove marbles and obstacles
- Toggle gravity on and off
- Drag marbles to reposition them
- Realistic collision physics
- Enhanced UI for better interaction


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faij1207/2D-Physics-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 2D-Physics-Simulation
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the simulation.

## Usage
- Click "Add Marble" to create a marble.
- Click "Add Obstacle" to create a static obstacle.
- Drag marbles to move them.
- Click "Toggle Gravity" to switch gravity on or off.
- Use the "Delete" button to remove marbles or obstacles.
