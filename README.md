# 2D-Physics-Simulation
This JavaScript-based 2D physics simulation demonstrates realistic physics concepts like gravity, collision detection, and object movement. Users can add marbles and obstacles, toggle gravity, and drag objects in real-time. This project serves as an engaging tool for learning and experimenting with basic physics principles.
